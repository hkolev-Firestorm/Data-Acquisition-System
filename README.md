# Data-Acquisition-System

Code for Data Acquisition System. Regarding turbojet testing --> Measured Thrust produced and Fuel Consumption Rate

Download **DataLog_Load.py** from the repo

Notes about the Dual Load Cell set-up:
"DL-IPS1.py" --> Engine Thrust code --> Currently set for COM3 port, 
"DL-IPSS2.py" --> Fuel Consumption code --> Currently set for COM4 port

Place each code in a seperate project! And you will most likely have to change the COM port to whichever COM port location you are using for your USB plug-in
